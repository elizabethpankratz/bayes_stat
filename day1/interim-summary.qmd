title: "Interim summary: The influence of priors"

**"Priors affect the posterior so much! Isn't that an unscientific way to do data analysis?"**

- If you *were* gonna actively mess with your analysis, using priors would be an embarrassingly transparent way to do it.
- **All analyses make assumptions, and all analyses are subjective.** 
  Bayesian approaches let you formalise your assumptions and put them up for debate. 
- Also: as the amount of data increases, the model's reliance on the priors decreases.
