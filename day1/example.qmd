title: "Example: Lexical decision task data"
---

Imagine that we've run a lexical decision experiment.
Participants are shown a word, and they have to decide whether it is a real word or not.

We have data from 100 trials.
Out of those 100 trials, participants answered correctly 80 times.

$$
\text{correct} = \frac{80}{100}
$$
<br>

**What is the probability of answering correctly?**
