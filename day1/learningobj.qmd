<!-- a prior belief + Bayesian updating -->
- What's the anatomy of an inferential Bayesian model?
<!-- Data ~ Likelihood(params) -->
<!-- params ~ priors -->
- How do different priors influence the model's estimates?
<!-- lots with little data -->
<!-- less with more data -->
- How does the model work out the posterior?
<!-- - How does Bayesian inference differ from frequentist inference? -->
<!-- discussed along the way, but show overview table at end -->
- How do Bayesian models generate data?
