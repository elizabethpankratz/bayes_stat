## Take-aways

- Practice dealing with uncertainty.
- What does a frequentist model do that a Bayesian model does not do? NHST vs. effect size estimation.
  - What is the difference between effect size estimation and hypothesis testing? 
    - What options are out there for Bayesian hypothesis testing? 
- What does a Bayesian model do that a frequentist model does not do?
  - Licenses more flexible interpretations, since we're not stuck in the binary of "reject the null or not".
- Why do some people prefer Bayesian analyses?
- Why is Bayes currently up and coming? / Why are frequentist models the standard?
